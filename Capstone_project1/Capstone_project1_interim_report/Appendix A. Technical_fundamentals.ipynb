At this point, you have cut the object into the smallest piece called **element** (i.e., the elementary building block of matter). Up to date there are 118 distinct elements (**Figure AI.1**). \n",

Each of the 118 elements can further be broken down into more fundamental building blocks called electrons, protons, and neutrons. Each of the 118 elements merely differ in the number of electrons, protons, and neutrons (**Figure AI.2**). Electrons, protons, and neutrons form **atoms**. The 118 elements (or atoms) are often depicted in a tabular form, arranged according to its electronic configuration the form of a periodic table. The elements exhibit similar group properties depending on how electrons, protons, and neutrons are arranged. The name of each element is abbreviated as a one- or two-letter symbol.   "

According to ISO 20473, IR light is divided into three groups: near-infrared spectrum, 780 nm to 3 $\\mu$m, (NIR); mid-infrared spectrum, 3-50 $\\mu$m (MIR), and far-infrared spectrum, 50 $\\mu$m-1 mm (FIR).

Shining MIR light and measuring the absorbed light yields a typical graph shown in **Figure AII.1.** The peaks in the graph represents the absorbed light and indicate the presence of certain organic functional groups. Alternatively, the spectrum can be depicted with the y-axis as transmittance. Also, note that the wavenumber is depicted is descending order, from 4000 to 400 cm-1, which corresponds to 2.5 $\\mu$m to 25 $\\mu$m.  "
