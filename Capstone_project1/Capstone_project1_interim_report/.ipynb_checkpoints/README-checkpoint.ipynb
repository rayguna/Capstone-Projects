    "Problem statement   \n",
    "With a rapid advancement in the fabrication of lightweight, compact, high-speed, and low-cost electronic/optoelectronic devices, the approach to using infrared spectroscopy for chemical identification is becoming widespread. For instance, Si-Ware Systems utilizes MEMS technology to fabricate an FTIR system in a chip size module (http://www.neospectra.com/products-overview/), in contrast to the traditional bench-top and bulky FTIR system. While it is relatively straightforward to correlate the infrared spectra of a defined class of compounds or a pure material, the spectra obtained from an FTIR measurement are generally ambiguous; it requires trained personnel to interpret the data, the process is tedious process, and is prone to errors. Thus, there is a need to establish a routine algorithm that yield a reliable and consistent result. The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy in a computer based chemical characterization of materials using IR spectroscopy.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
    "How does it benefit the client  \n",
    "The client is an FTIR spectroscopy sensor manufacturer that desires a universal method for unambiguously identifying the chemical compounds of an unknown material from the measured FTIR spectra. The conventional approach used to identify FTIR spectra is to mathematically compare the unknown spectra against all possible spectra within the database (i.e., a spectral matching approach). The reference compounds with similar spectral features to the unknown material are ranked according to their similarity index. If it is done on a defined class of material, this process is very likely to yield an accurate result; however, for an entirely unknown material it will require a trained professional to then rationalize the result. The human interference is not necessarily consistent and error-proof. The proposed approach is to utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural network and cluster analysis) to take into account the chemical information in combination with the spectral matching approach. A successful model is expected to yield an error proof routine to chemical compound identification that yields consistent results. \n",

    "1. The main reference/training data set of over 40,000 spectra of known chemical compounds will be automatically downloaded from NIST website (http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/vib-ser/) with the aid of a python script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A group frequency table will be downloaded or web-scraped from a certain website to aid in chemical group assignment of occuring peaks in the FTIR spectra. There are a number of websites that carry this information, but the appropriate website will be selected for its reliable source of information and completeness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. A list of representative FTIR spectra that have been properly assigned will be downloaded from NIST website (http://cccbdb.nist.gov); it will be used to verify the accuracy of the peak assignment that rely on the group frequency table.    \n",
